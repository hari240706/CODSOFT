## **Completed Tasks**

### **Task 1: Number Guessing Game**
**Description**:  
A console-based game where the computer generates a random number, and the user must guess it. The program provides feedback on each guess and continues until the user guesses correctly.

**Learning Outcomes**:  
- Understanding random number generation.
- Handling user input and validation.
- Utilizing loops and conditionals for program flow.

---

### **Task 2: Simple Calculator**
**Description**:  
A menu-driven calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, based on user input.

**Learning Outcomes**:  
- Working with switch-case constructs.
- Implementing error handling for edge cases (e.g., division by zero).
- Structuring user-friendly interactive programs.

---

### **Task 3: Tic-Tac-Toe Game**
**Description**:  
A two-player console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where players alternate turns until one wins or the game ends in a draw.

**Learning Outcomes**:  
- Managing a dynamic 2D grid structure.
- Developing logic for win/draw conditions.
- Enhancing program modularity through functions.

---

## **Internship Key Takeaways**

- Enhanced problem-solving and logical reasoning skills using C++.
- Gained hands-on experience in designing and implementing real-world projects.
- Improved code structuring and documentation practices.
- Learned the importance of debugging and user interaction in application development.
