## **Completed Tasks**

### **Task 1: Number Guessing Game**
**Description**:
A console-based game in which the computer picks a random number, and the user is to guess it. The program gives feedback after every guess and continues until the user guesses correctly.

**Learning Outcomes**:
- How to generate random numbers.
- Handling user input and validation.
- Using loops and conditionals for program flow.

---

### **Task 2: Simple Calculator**
**Description**: A menu-driven calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.

**Learning Outcomes**: - Use switch-case constructs.
- Use error handling for edge cases such as division by zero.
- Structure user-friendly interactive programs.

---

### **Task 3: Tic-Tac-Toe Game**
**Description**:
A two-player console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where players alternate turns until one wins or the game ends in a draw.

**Learning Outcomes**:
- Managing a dynamic 2D grid structure.
- Developing logic for win/draw conditions.
- Enhancing program modularity through functions.

---

## **Internship Key Takeaways**

- Enhanced problem-solving and logical reasoning skills using C++.
- Gained hands-on experience in designing and implementing real-world projects.
- Improved code structuring and documentation practices.
- Learnt importance of debugging and user interaction in application development.
