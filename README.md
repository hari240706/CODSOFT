CODSOFT C++ Programming Internship

This repository contains the activities carried out during the CODSOFT C++ programming internship. The internship aims to improve skills in developing C++ programs by hands-on real-world project development and implementation in real life.

Completed Tasks

Task 1: Number Guessing Game

Description:
A console game where the computer generates a random number and the player is supposed to guess this number. The program delivers feedback after each guess till the player guesses correctly.

Learning Outcomes:
How to produce random numbers.
Processing input from the user and input validation.
Loops and conditionals controlling program flow.

Task 2: Simple Calculator

Description: Menu-driven calculator program performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on a user choice.

Learning Outcomes:
Use switch-case constructs.
Use error handling in edge cases such as division by zero.
Design user-friendly interactive programs.

Task 3: Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Description:
It is a two-player console-based game of Tic-Tac-Toe where players take turns in a game that ends when one player wins or when there is no winner and the game is a draw.

Learning Outcomes:
Managing a dynamic 2D grid structure.
Developing logic for win/draw conditions.
Improving program modularity using functions.

Internship Key Takeaways:

Improved problem-solving and logical reasoning skills using C++.
Hands-on experience in designing and implementing real-world projects.
Improved code structuring and documentation practices.
Learned the significance of debugging and user interaction in application development.

Acknowledgments:

Thanks to CodSoft for this opportunity to expand my knowledge in C++ programming. This internship has helped to fill the gap between theory and practice that was missing during studies.
